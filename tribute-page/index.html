        <p id="tribute-info">Grandpa Son Gohan is a martial artist who was Master Roshi's number one pupil. He is the adoptive grandfather of Goku.
Due to being accidentally killed by a rampaging Great Ape Goku before the start of the Dragon Ball series, he does not fully debut until his disguised appearance as "The Mysterious Fifth Man" alongside Fortuneteller Baba's other fighters, where he temporarily reunites with Goku. In anime filler, he currently holds a position as Annin's attendant and bodyguard of the Furnace of Eight Divisions.
Grandpa Gohan is responsible for giving Son Goku his Earth name and serves as an important mentor and parent figure in his life, being firstly responsible for Goku's kindhearted and heroic nature. His legacy runs deep through his adoptive grandson's family, as Goku's son Gohan was named in honor of him.</p>
